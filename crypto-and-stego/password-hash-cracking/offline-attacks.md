# Offline Attacks

## Hashcat

### General

`hashcat [Optionen] <Hash/Hashfile> <Wordlist>`

#### Identifie Hash-Type

`hashid <HASH>`

#### Options:

| -a    | attack mode (0 = Dictionary Attacl, 3 = Brute-Force) |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| -m    | hash mode (0 = MD5)                                  |
| -o    |                                                      |
| —show | Displays the cracked password when successfull       |

### attack modes

#### Dictionary Attack

The dictionary attack, or “straight mode,” is a very simple attack mode. It is also known as a “Wordlist attack”.

All that is needed is to read line by line from a textfile (aka “dictionary” or “wordlist”) and try each line as a password candidate.

`hashcat -a 0 -m 0 f806fc5a2a0d5ba2471600758452799c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt —show`

`-a 0` sets mode to dictionary attack

`-m 0` sets to MD5 type

#### Brute-Force Attack

Tries all combinations from a given Keyspace. It is the easiest of all the attacks.

`hashcat -a 3 -m 0 05A5CF06982BA7892ED2A6D38FE832D6 ?d?d?d?d`

`-a 3` sets mode to brute-force attack

`?d?d?d?d` the ?d tells hashcat to use a digit (?d?d?d?d = four digits 0000 - 9999)

* ?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
* ?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
* ?d = 0123456789
* ?h = 0123456789abcdef
* ?H = 0123456789ABCDEF
* ?s = «space»!"#$%&'()\*+,-./:;<=>?@\[\\]^\_\`{|}\~
* ?a = ?l?u?d?s
* ?b = 0x00 - 0xff

#### Rule-Based attacks

Also known as hybrid attacks.

Attacker know something about the password policy. for example, manipulating or 'mangling' a password such as 'password': p@ssword, Pa\$$word, Passw0rd, and so on.

### Hash mode Hashcat

[https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example\_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example\_hashes)

| 900 | MD4   |
| --- | ----- |
| 0   | MD5   |
| 100 | SHA-1 |

### Show cracked password

repeat crack command and add `-show` at the end
