# Spraying attack

**Password Spraying** is an effective technique for **identifying valid credentials** and is commonly used to uncover **weak passwords**. It's applied to various **online services** and **authentication systems** like SSH, SMB, RDP, SMTP, and Outlook Web Application. Unlike **Brute-Force attacks**, which try many weak passwords for a single username, a Password Spraying attack targets **many usernames with one common weak password**. This approach can help avoid **account lockout policies**.

**Commonly used weak passwords**:

1. **Current season** followed by the **current year** (e.g., **Fall2020**, **Spring2021**).
2. **Current month** followed by the **current year** (e.g., **November2020**, **March2021**).
3. **Company name** with random **numbers** (e.g., **TryHackMe01**, **TryHackMe02**).
4. With **password complexity policies**: Passwords with **symbols** (e.g., **October2021!**, **Spring2021!**).

For a successful Password Spraying attack, it's crucial to **compile a list of valid usernames** (or **email addresses**).

## Usernames

```bash
$ cat usernames-list.txt
admin
victim
dummy
adm
sammy
```

### Hydra

Hydra can perfom password attacks (one user - multiple pwds) such as spray attacks (multiple user - one pwds) just use `hydra -L user-list.txt -p 12345`

`-l` specific user “admin”

`-L` User list

`-p` specific password “12345”

`-P` password list

## ssh

`hydra -L usernames-list.txt -p Spring2021 ssh://10.1.1.10`

see online attacks for more details

## **RDP**
